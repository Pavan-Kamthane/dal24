            The University of Mysore was established on July 27, 1916. It is the
            sixth oldest in the country and the first in the state of Karnataka.
            Also, in a sense it is the first university of the country to be
            established outside the limits of the British India. The university
            was founded as a result of the efforts of the benevolent and
            visionary Maharaja of erstwhile Princely State of Mysore His
            Highness Shri Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar â€“ IV (1884-1940), and the
            then Diwan Sir M. Visvesvaraya (1860-1962). It was the first
            University to be accredited by NAAC in 2000 with Five Star Status
